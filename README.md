# deep-learning-final-project
This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify car images into Damaged and Not Damaged categories. The model is trained on a curated dataset of car images and deployed using Gradio for easy, interactive testing. It includes dataset preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and a web-based demo for real-time predictions.
